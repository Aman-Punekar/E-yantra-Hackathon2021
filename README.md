# TITLE: RudhiraBindu-One Stop For Plasma


## Idea
The main goal of our project is to provide a platform for contact details of the registered plasma donors in the city as soon as possible as it is too difficult to find a plasma donor. 
		The future scope involves being a one stop solution for all the facilities concerned with blood availability connecting blood donors to those who need it across the country to avoid numerous heartbreaking deaths caused because a patient wasn't able to find a donor in time. 

## Description  
In Convalescent Plasma Therapy, plasma collected from recovered patients is infused into patients who are currently covid positive. Meeting blood requirements continues to be a challenge across India. The idea is to build a platform for such patients to find the donors on their finger tips at the earliest. 
Firstly, the recovered patients who wish to save life by donating plasma need to register and create his/her profile in our application providing required information. Donor can also share his/her winning story against coronavirus to motivate others. 
Volunteers from the city will authenticate and verify the donor meeting the medical eligibility.
Patients can look for a donor from the home page mentioning the city and blood group in need. The verified donors from the city will be presented in the home page providing the contact details of the donor. Patients can call the appropriate donors . Patients can also read the corresponding donor's triumph story against covid.

## Future Scope
The same platform can be used for finding blood in emergency,
Where the blood banks are provided with the login to add the available blood types.
